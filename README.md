# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript E6

# Optimizations
#### The Javascript was written using object oriented programming. 

# Lesson Learned: 
#### I learned how to program the game in an object oriented manner. I declared functions wrapped in objects to reduce complexity. Using OOP also allowed for more efficient use of the properties and methods in separate objects and function declarations.
